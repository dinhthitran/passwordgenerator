# Password-Generator
```
Homework Assignment #3 Monash Bootcamp 2021 - JavaScript

This week's project was designed as a homework assignment for Monash Coding Bootcamp 2021.

The application is focused on JavaScript to enable users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. It runs in the browser and features dynamicaly updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

It includes a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

    * How many characters would you like your password? Choose between 8 and 128
        - If a valid value is not placed you will be alerted.
    In the following prompts one of the criterias must be selected.

    - Prompts user for input between 8-128 characters
    - variable changed to integer using parseInt
    - Will then validate that the input is a number within range, or is a number
    - The input is then used to determine the types (or choices) or letters of characters using an if statement
    * Another variable is created to join (concatenate) the above variables
    * A for loop will loop through the prompt until it reaches the entered by the user.
    * A password variable  takes that value from the loop and converts it to a string.
    * The string values then populate into the text area for the user using a function write password


### Notes

* The array of variables and possible combinations can be cleaner by using charcodes with a for loop. (Just no more time to research)
